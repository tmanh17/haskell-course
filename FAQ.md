### I can't run the code cells in the VSCode instance!

As of now, the Haskell kernel is configured to work only with a Binder instance. The VSCode instance is only for the homework. Mainly because we didn't want to encourage students to use their free 50 hs/month of GitPod while going through the lesson if there's a free and open-source alternative (Binder). 

### There's no binder button!

If that's the case, that lesson hasn't been published yet. When it's finalized and recorded, we'll add the button.

### Do I have to pay anything to use all these resources?

NO!
- The content is free and open source.
- The cloud service we use to host the interactive versions is also free.
- And the GitPod instance we use to run the VSCode has a free tier of 50 hs/month, which we believe will be more than enough. In the case you need more than 50 hs/month to do the homework, you can clone the repo and run everything locally (You can install everything using [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).

### I want something to be different!

Tell us! We want this to be an easy and fun way to learn Haskell. If the community want's something different, we'll adapt the course!

### I have other questions!

- About Haskell? Look for the Haskell channel in [IOG's technical community](https://discord.com/invite/cmveaxuzBn). We'll be there to answer questions!
- About the repo or the course itself? Create an [issue](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell-course/issues)!
